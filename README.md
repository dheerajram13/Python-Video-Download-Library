# Python-Video-Download-Library
This is a library used to download course material from various online course sites. The current process is very tedious, the student has to download the files individually and this is really time consuming. The library will use scrappy to get the information from the website. The user will be asked to enter the URL of the course website, then the library will do rest of the work. First using the provided URL, it will make a http request, next the library will use scrappy to get extract the individual video tags. Then once the video tags are extracted the video can be downloaded using scrapy’s media pipeline. The video will be saved to the user’s computer. The library will initially have support for Open Courseware, then the future support for other websites can be provided.Intially this project has been implemented for MIT OpenCourseware.
